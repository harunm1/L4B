This app is developed as an aid for learning for young toddlers(ages 1 - 2).
The app was created in Android Studio and has an apk attached to tis folder as well as
all the project contents.
The app consists of a main menu through which the categories of learning can be accessed.
These categories are alphabets, numbers, colors and shapes. It has an added feature of
nursery rhymes. Once each of these categories is clicked another layout will appear on the screen.
For alphabets, once clicked a page with all the alphabets will appear and when an alphabet is clicked
a sound recording of that alphabet will be played. The same idea can be applied to all the other categories.
To go back to the main menu, on can hit the back button on their respective phones or even rotate the screen
to landscape mode.
